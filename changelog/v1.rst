Security Center 1.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    - This release refactored the architecture between tenant-based UI, administrative UI
      and the servers. This also implies a full refactor of the API.
    - If you have installed the Security Center and the Security Center Model
      on same servers, you can upgrade those components without any implications
    - If you have installed the Security Center and the Security Center Model
      on different servers, the following things will change for you:
      
        1) The administrative UI is no more available from the Security Center server, the administrative UI
           will be instead served on the Security Center Model server.
        2) The administrative UI can no longer use the same https TLS certificate as the tenant-based UI,
           you will have to generate a new certificate for the admin UI in the administrative UI settings section.
        3) The license has to be re-imported in the administrative UI
