Credentials
===========

You can log into the Backend and Frontend with the following
default credentials. The admin user will work for both services.

| ``User: admin``
| ``Password: admin``

After you logged in for the first time, you have to change the
default password before you can continue.

The password has to be at least 12 characters long and contain
at least one lowercase alphabet, uppercase alphabet, digit and
special character.

After you have changed the default password, we advise to set up
the second factor. You can do this by clicking your username in
the top right corner and navigating to ``User Settings``.
