Password Reset
==============

Since the password for the admin user is stored only on the Backend,
you have to reset the password via console. To reset the password for
the ``admin`` user on the **Security Center Backend**, run the following
command via console:

.. code-block:: console

    nextron@sc-back:~$ sudo asgard-security-center-backend set-password
    Please enter password for user `admin`: 
    Please re-enter password for user `admin`: 
    nextron@sc-back:~$
